# VallayZ Interspecies Message Passing Networks: A Unified Framework for Multi-Modal Latent Space Linking 
A new neural network architecture + message passing algorithm to connect multimodal data via stochastic micro-variants and selective gating.

## Abstract
Interspecies Message Passing Networks (IMPNs) and the VallayZ framework is a neural network architecture for robust communication between heterogeneous latent spaces. Similar to the nutrient-exchange mechanisms of mycorrhizal fungal networks, IMPNs/VallayZ employ stochastic micro-variant sampling and selective receptor gating to enable efficient cross-modal translation while remaining resilient to noise and missing modalities. Each modality is projected into a unified latent “soil” space via learned adapters, where messages are exchanged as sets of perturbed variants. Receivers apply learned gating to select and aggregate the most relevant variants, refining their internal state before decoding back to their native space.

## Loss Metrics

The VallayZ / IMPN training objective combines multiple complementary loss terms to ensure robust multi-modal alignment:

- **Contrastive Loss (InfoNCE):**  
  Encourages aligned modality pairs to have higher similarity than mismatched pairs, improving cross-modal retrieval accuracy.

- **Cycle Consistency Loss:**  
  Ensures that a mapping from Modality A → B → A (or vice versa) reconstructs the original latent representation, preserving reversibility.

- **kNN Preservation Loss:**  
  Maintains neighborhood structure after projection, ensuring that semantically similar inputs remain close in the shared latent space.

- **Orthogonality Regularization:**  
  Encourages projection matrices to remain close to orthonormal, supporting invertible and stable transformations.

- **Denoising Regularization:**  
  Promotes robustness to perturbations in the shared space by penalizing deviation from the clean aggregated signal.

The **total loss** is a weighted sum:  
\[
\mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 L_{\text{contrast}} + \lambda_2 L_{\text{cycle}} + \lambda_3 L_{\text{knn}} + \lambda_4 L_{\text{orth}} + \lambda_5 L_{\text{denoise}}
\]

These terms together balance **alignment**, **structure preservation**, and **robustness** across heterogeneous modalities.



## Ancient Tibetian Translation 
Using **VallayZ / IMPN**, we built a **tri-modal translation bridge**:

- **Modality A:** Ancient Tibetan text embeddings  
- **Modality B:** Generated audio transliterations  
- **Modality C:** Modern English translations  

By aligning these modalities in a shared latent **soil space** and exchanging **stochastic micro-variants** with **selective gating**, the model learns to focus on the most relevant semantic variants for each translation context.

**Results** *(4,000 epochs, ~30 min training)*:  
- **Top-1 accuracy:** 77%  
- **Top-5 accuracy:** 88%
